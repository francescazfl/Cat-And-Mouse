# subclasses of Turtle
# The Mouse should just runs around in the circle,
# on the edge of the Statue,
# with a linear speed of 1 m/s
# 1 meter = 100 pixels and every time step is 10 milliseconds.
# speed = 1 in your program, it means 1 pixel per 10 ms,
#  which is also equivalent to 1 m/s.
# The distance between coordinates (100, 100) and (100, 200) is 1 meter or 100 pixels.

# pass in the Arena and Statue instance to both Cat and Mouse.

# The Mouse should just run forever while the Cat should control the simulation.
# While the Cat catches the mouse, it should call the following command to stop the simulation.
# (The Arena instance should be passed into Cat.__init__() as an argument)
# arena.stop()
# The cat will give up after 30 seconds.
# use the time computed by the Arena with the following command:
# arena.get_timestamp() # Time in milliseconds
