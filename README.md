# Cat-And-Mouse Game

*An Artificial Life Simulation: a user-interactive game with the Turtle Graphics and Tkinter GUI package*

There is a cat that watches a mouse run around the base of a statue in a park. While the mouse moves counterclockwise around the statue, the cat either moves toward the statue with the same speed if the mouse is in the visible range or circulates counterclockwise at 1.25 times speed of the mouse otherwise. The cat would give up after the time that the user set upfront. 

Throughout, the user can click the “run” button to start a default case. More clicks on the button would accelerate the process. The “step” button precedes the game in a step-by-step fashion. After the user hits the “stop” button the orange cat can be slowly dragged and moved around to a new position. If the user is not satisfied with how the cat is performing, the “reset” would restart the particular game with the same settings. When the user is ready to leave the game, double-click on the “quit” button would exit the game.
